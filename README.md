# Virtual Menu 🍽️

## Description 📚
MenuDesign is a web page project that simulates a digital menu, allowing users to navigate intuitively among different options for main courses, desserts, and beverages. This project uses technologies such as React, Vite, and Node.js, to facilitate user interaction, making it a dynamic, simple, interactive, fun, and inviting gastronomic platform.

## Features 🔄

- View main courses, desserts, and beverages.
- Instantaneous interface update as user interactions occur.

## Technology Stack 💻

- **JavaScript:** Acts as the conductor of the project, controlling visual elements and defining objects related to main courses, desserts, and beverages. It does not directly manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) or render elements on the interface, but it responds to user interactions, allowing intuitive navigation.
- **React:** Manages the state of items selected by users, ensuring a dynamic update that is reflected instantly in the interface. This provides an intuitive and real-time interaction with the menu. React is responsible for rendering components and efficiently manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model).
- **Vite:** Used to run the project with better productivity, quality, performance, and optimized support for React. Although not directly involved in the project's logic, Vite provides an agile and efficient infrastructure for development.
- **Node.js:** Used to run command scripts outside the browser, facilitating build, start, and other project-related operations.
- **CSS:** Responsible for styling the project, providing an attractive and consistent visual presentation.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
